# StarTrekWebScraper

## Project Description

Goal: Scrape the [Star Trek Wiki pages listing canon planets](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Planets) to determine what percentage of planets are habitable, and what the distribution of officers by rank is.

Quick note: all results are biased based on what the wiki editors have made a record of. Not all Starfleet officer's pages, for example, have their rank listed.

Technical components: Python script that uses Beautiful Soup (chosen for its simplicity, we do not have to scrape any dynamically generated pages). Analyze and visualize results in a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and MatPlotLib.

## Project Plan

- [x] Pick a webscraping utility
- [ ] Understand the format of planet status on wiki
