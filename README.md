# StarTrekWebScraper

## Project Description

Goal: Scrape the [Star Trek Wiki pages listing canon planets](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Planets) to determine what percentage are habitable.

Quick note: all results are biased based on what the wiki editors have made a record off. Not all Starfleet officer's pages, for example, have their rank listed.

Technical components: Python script that uses Beautiful Soup (chosen for its simplicity, we do not have to scrape any dynamically generated pages)

## Project Plan

- [x] Pick a webscraping utility
- [ ] Understand the format of planet status on wiki
